# DBLP_Parser
Working on a research team at the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
### Project Description:
An interactive social network visualization tool that represents the relationship between authors on DBLP. 

I'm currently constructing an XML parser in Python to efficiently parse through 5.4 million entries and obtain clean data. 

### Note: 
The DBLP dumpfiles are found on the dblp website. Not included here because the files are too large.
